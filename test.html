<h1>Redesigning Mel.org for Librarians</h1>

<div>

<div class="row">
<strong>The Challenge: </strong> Redesign the state e-library <a href="http://www.mel.org/">portal</a> for librarians as <thead>
  in Michigan state as the primary target audience.

</div>
<div class="row">
<strong>The Outcome: </strong> Over the semester my team and I came up with detailed recommendations and six thorough user experience research reports for the Mel.org team. These recommendations were
appreciated by the team and are already live on the website.

Note: The screenshots here are from the previous version of the website, i.e from Feb 2018.
</div>
<div class="row">
<strong>Spoiler: </strong> By the end of this three month long research project my team and I had created six 2000 word reports, 5 slideshows, and a video summarizing our findings.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>In February of 2018, I got together with two other UX students from the University of Michigan to work with the Michigan eLibrary to explore the user experience of their website especially from the perspective of public librarians in the state of Michigan.</p>

<p>To understand and scope the problem we framed a few high level research questions</p>
<ul>

<li>How might we make the resources on MeL more accessible for librarians?</li>
<li>How might we improve the flow of information from Librarians to the society?</li>
<li>How might we minimize variations in experience of using MeL among users with less or no exposure to digital technology?</li>
</ul>

<p>The following sections talks in detail about our process and challenges.</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
Over the semester we applied User research methods as shown in the flowchart to explore the framed research questions and generate insights at each level. These recommendations worked as input for the next and were also helpful in gathering
feedback from the client on a biweekly basis. Thus in the end we had refined recommendations which are now live on the website.

<h4>Interaction Map for Mel.org</h4>

<p>Before redesigning interactions for Librarians we decided to understand major workflows on the websitea and ways in which <thead>
Librarian interacts with them. The goal was to identify break points and get an overall understanding of the website's information architecture.

</div>
<br>
<p>
From the interaction map we learned that a wide variety of online training material is available specifically  for librarians. They can use these tools and training to promote and get the best use out of Michigan eLibrary databases, portal resources, and Michigana (http://MeL.org/promotions). </p>
<p>Librarians in Michigan are the face of MeL for major section of the society like the elderly and school students. They are aware of what the local community needs and hence looking closely at their experience with MeL can guide us towards insightful findings to improve overall usability of Mel.org too.

<ul class="shortcuts-list">
  <li class="shortcuts">
    <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#Interviews">
      <h3>Interviews</h3>
      <p>4 librarians who work in rural libraries in Michigan with
        low level technology use while each of them has a different background and job role. </p>
        </a>
  </li>

  <li class="shortcuts">
    <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#Competetive-Analysis">
      <h3>Competetive Analysis</h3>
      <p>To assess the functionalities and quality of MeL specific to librarians (from a user’s perspective instead of features) we selected six competitors.
      </p>
    </a>
  </li>

  <li class="shortcuts">
    <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#Survey">
      <h3>Survey</h3>
      <p>To investigate how effective the current sections on MeL are in supporting librarians
        we sent out a survey to librarians working at public libraries in Michigan State.</p>
    </a>
  </li>

  <li class="shortcuts">
    <a class="shortcuts-link" href="#Heuristic-Evaluation">
      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
      <p>With many heuristics available we decided to pick one of the most popular
        ones, Nielsen's heuristic to evaluate and find usability issues in MeL.
      </p>
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2 id="Interviews">Interviews</h2>
<p>After the four interviews, we reviewed the notes taken, listened to the audio recordings and turned the audio into transcribed notes. To reinforce the process, we also used IBM Speech to Text API to help us finalize the transcript.
We adopted Open Coding method to analyze our interview data in excel.
</p><p>First we looked at each interview, then each theme, and eventually discovered overall insights.

<h2 id="Competetive-Analysis">Competetive Analysis</h2>
<p>Through the competetive analysis we learned that by looking at
other services in the elibrary space MeL can improve its search functionality, update to a consistent as well as intuitive visual design and use content specific categorization in the navigation bars.</p>
<div>
  <img src="./images/competetive.png" alt="competetive">
 </div>
<h2 id="Survey">Survey</h2>
<p>According to the clien (who distributed our survey through library channels) our survey reached all public libraries in Michigan and we are confident that this sample is able to represent our target audience.</p>
<p>The results of a few multiple choice questions were not as reliable because participants who  chose “Other” didn’t all elaborate on their choice although corresponding text entry boxes were provided. Though we did a textual analysis of the  “Other” answers it did not give us clear objective data we had expected.
</p>
<p>Some of the more data rich questions we asked:</p>
<div>
<img src="./images/survey.png" alt="survey">
</div>

<p>A key insight from another question:</p>
<blockquote>
 Regardless of how participants learned to use MeL, they have the most difficulties when using MeLCat, Database, and Promotion & Training section.
</blockquote>
<div>
 <img src="./images/survey2.png" alt="survey">
</div>
<p>Our next step was to model our heuristic evaluations and usability testing with limitations and survey results in mind. </p>

<h2 id="Heuristic-Evaluation">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
<p>
Our heuristic evaluation involved several steps: first we defined the task and use cases on MeL. Next, we defined heuristics, variables and severity. Then, we evaluated heuristics individually, and combined all the results at the end.

<h2>Results</h2>

<div>

<div >
1. MeL has a vast pool of resources. However, most librarians find it hard to navigate or find desirable information.
<br>
</div>

<blockquote>
Provide supportive information that is prominent to users on different pages. The information could be short videos or articles to education users the best way to use MeL.
Design a more in-depth navigation with clear information hierarchy to help users quickly locate the information they need.
</blockquote>

<div >

2. Promotion and Training section is hard to navigate because resources are not organized the way users expect.
Some sub sections have over than 20 entries, while some have only one entry.
<br>
</div>
<blockquote>
Clean up duplicated resources and categorize them by topic. Some possible headers could be:
Tutorials,
Workshop, and
Promotion material.
“Librarians love filters” : Provide filters to choose different types of resources like video/article/website.
Consider add a search bar for Promotion & Training section.

</blockquote>

<div>
3. The search function on Mel confuses users.
  <br>
</div>

<blockquote>
Visually emphasize the message of different search bars,
build a search function that  searches the whole site, and
remove the conflicting message on the promotion and training pages.

</blockquote>
</div>
