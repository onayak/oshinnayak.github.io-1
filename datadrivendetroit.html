  <div class="section-header">Overview</div>
  During a three month internship at Nutanix, San Jose I had the opportunity to explore four enterprise UX projects at different phases of the design process. Apart from work, my weeks were packed with networking events, bootcamps, and intern outings. Here's a quick walkthrough of my first UX internship!
  Due to the NDA agreement instead of discussing the prototypes created or components worked on I will be focussing on the process and tools used in the following projects explored:

      <h3 id="user-archetypes"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Creating User Archetypes</h3>
      <p>This project’s end result was changing the project itself.</p>
      <p>Goal: Create a UX Research plan and define user archetypes needed.</p>

    <!--  <p>I took the task of analysing these interviews using Nvivo to code the transcripts.
      </p>
      <p>Overall my analysis led to one major insight: The interview script needs to be modified.</p>
      <p>In the infrasture world role or position of users and their work aren’t mapped consistently
        through the university. This led us to also consider modifying the interview scripts and the study plan itself. Instead of just interviewing customers
        we decided to talk to employees who had been in the firm for years and could shed light on issues customers faced in detail. We also updated the end goal to Creating User
        Archetypes, instead of just personas. <p>


     <p> To create high fidelity prototypes for Nutanix Prism components was the most challenging part of my
        internship because I had to redesign a perfectly functional and usable component.</p>

        <p> Through usability tests with customers it had been clear that most users did not know much about
        the process of creating a file sever works on Nutanix Node. With no direct competitors this wasn't a
          conventional workflow and was specific to Nutanix Prism.</p>-->

            <h3 id="file-servers" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Redesigning File Servers</h3>
          <p>Goal: To help users have a clear understanding of the File server creation process so that they cab efficiently
             utilize the available resources.</p>
             <p>How did I design a new flow with visual aspects?</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Analysed the usability data from .NEXT Nice and DC for Visual flows for AFS.</li>
<li>Used <a href="https://maze.design/">maze.design</a> to share the redesigned prototypes and collect comprehensive feedback to use for future iterations. (See screenshots below.)</li>
<li>Conducted usability tests with UI engineer and a backend engineer.</li></ul>

      <h3 id="network-visualizations" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Visualize your Network</h3>
      <p>In a three day Hackathon my team and I tried to answer a common question Network admins have:
      Which node is not working? In the world of datacenter admins we learned that error dectection is a complex time consuming
      task. </p>
      <p>Mapping physical connections in a datacenter to a visual network topology would help reduce some of this complexity.
        Our proposed design used simple shapes (nodes) and red colored dots (errored link source) to indicate overall state of the datacenter. Our deign rationale
        was based on the following
    </p>
    <blockquote> To monitor a complex system where mutiple things can go wrong, an efficient error dectection
    system could be static when all systems are up. In case of an error, it could indicate it through motion,
  color, and concentrated activity in the errored region.  </blockquote>
    <blockquote> Reduce the cognitive load by displaying details in progressive manner. </blockquote>
    <p>Due to the NDA agreement the designs cannot be shared here.</p>

      <h3 id="feature-creation" style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Feature Creation</h3>

<p>My fourth project involved coming up with a completely new feature to improve engagement between Nutanix Prism and its users.
This involved a process of low fidelity sketches, competetive analysis ,calls with the CTO, and a lot of brainstorming. </p>
<p>The most important takeaway for me as an intern was the opportunity to explore this part of the design process, think about business goals vs design goals, and put on my creative hat.</p>
