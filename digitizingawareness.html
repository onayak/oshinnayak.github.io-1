  <div class="section-header" id="top">Overview</div>
  <p>Through a individual project I explored the idea of creating an art exhibit which mediates a positive atmosphere and creates awareness about issues in inaccessible parts of the world .
This was a masters' final project and hlped me appreciate ideas of <strong>speculative thinking, sustainable design, design noirs, and humanity centered design</strong>.

  <div class="section-header">My Role</div>
  <p style="text-align: center;color:#34515E; font-weight:600;">Product Designer, UX Designer<p>
  <p> This was an individual project and required me to take on multiple roles. I also incorporated user feedback
  in the research, brainstorming, and prototyping phase to ensure creating an unbiased exhibit. </p>
<br>
  <div class="section-header">Problem</div>
  When we think about genocide in the 21st century it feels rather unsettling. Conversations on Twitter first introduced me to the Rohingya Refugee Crisis. The UNHCR handle <a href="https://twitter.com/RefugeesMedia">posts</a> highlights this issue in detail.

  <div class="section-header">Solution</div>
A museum exhibit using lights to create data visualizations on the Rohingya Crisis. In a dark room these visualizations would
be projected on the walls. On exiting the exhibit room vistors would learn more about the they saw.

            <p class="p-small">WHY?</p>
            <p>The numerous publications on immigrant issues, popular data visualizations, and case studies on museums

            <p>A sucessful museum exhibit would depend on the visitors feedback. I also wanted to gauge how much people

  <div class="section-header-2" id="research"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Secondary Research</div>

<p>
  This step concentrated on learning about managing art projects with societal impact. I also studied many exhibits like
  "How to make sense of the art + data?" created by <a href="http://giorgialupi.com/ ">Giorgia Lupi</a>.

  <blockquote>In this exhibit she explores the notion of inclusive growth and the role that heritage can play in contributing to social inclusion as well as economic growth for sustainable development.
</blockquote>
 Literature reviews and a detailed study of cases on art exhibits showed how art influences the society and can mediate
 difficult times.

</p>


  <div class="section-header-2" id="interviews"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Interviews and Data Gathering</div>
  Interviews helped learn what different visitors knew about the Rohingya crisis, what their museum experience had been like,
  and which exhibits were memorable for them.

  <img src="./images/interviewbook.png" alt="research for exhibit">

    <br>


  <div class="section-header-2" id="prototyping"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">Exhibit Prototypes</div>

Prototyping multiple iterations by different methods like Arduino, fairy lights, and d3 data viz directed
the final desing of the exhibit prototype.
<br>
<blockquote>The quickest way to get feedback was sharing my prototype with peers and potential visitors.
</blockquote>
<br>
<img src="./images/exhibit_prototype.png" alt="research for exhibit">


  <div class="section-header-2" id="enactments"style="padding-bottom:5%;padding-top:5%;">User Enactments and Final Prototype</div>
<p>User enactments finalized the workflow for the exhibit. How would users encounter the exhibit? How would they
exit it? Here are a few snaps from the user enactments conducted. </p>
<p>The final prototype had four main parts: <strong>Exploring, Learning, Participating, and Reflecting</strong></p>

<p> <strong>Exploring: </strong>Visitors would enter a dark room with data visualizations projected on one of the walls. They
would view it and then exit the room. </p>

<p> <strong> Learning: </strong>At the exit door visitors would encounter information boards explaining the digital art they viewed.
 </p>

 <p> <strong> Participating: </strong>They would then be given an oppurtunity to send a handwritten message to children in
   the Rohingya refugee camps. Then they would be guided to look into a key hole.
  </p>

  <p> <strong> Reflecting:</strong> The keyhole would allow them to look back into the same room and view another visualization,
  this time with more information about what they were looking at.</p>

<div class="section-header">Reflection</div>
<blockquote> Making this exhibit helped me appreciate art, making, and prototyping.
</blockquote>

<p>
  My project focuses on refugees and the alarming atrocities against them. Through my research I learned about artists, teachers, designers, and engineers working towards solving different aspects of the global refugee crisis. They served as great inspirations while diverging on ideas, solving conflicts, and testing when my ideas didn’t work as expected. If I could go back in time and change something I would probably start the prototyping and ‘making’ phase using raw ideas much earlier. Apart from brainstorming another aspect of the process I got stuck on was narrowing my focus to one particular group of refugees. After using my physical design workbook to collect answers for questions like “What do you think refugee camps look like” and “Who do you think refugees are”, I got a true sense of what users felts about the cause. Expert interviews reinforced the same conclusion that there was no particular bias towards a specific group of refugees within the general public, it was more about awareness of what was happening in other inaccessible parts of the world.
