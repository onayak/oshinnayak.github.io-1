  	<strong>The Challenge: </strong> With a team of students from Art & Design, Business, Engineering and Information, work in a competitive product development environment to create a product with active technology for geriatrics, to help improve their health.

  </div>
  <div class="row">
  	<strong>The Outcome: </strong> This project was part of the Integrated Product Design course at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. This innovative course has been featured on CNN and written up in the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Businessweek.
    By the semester my team and I had created a working prototype of a smart seat which was portable, foldable, and could give a slight boost while getting up.
  </div>
  <div class="row">
  	<strong>Spoiler: </strong> The prototype was demoed at IPD 2018 Trade show and UMSI Exposition 2018 where about 100 people got to interact with it.<h5>You can find some fun images from the IPD 2018 Trade Show <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/94038283@N06/27669147848/in/album-72157690012442420/"> here</a>.</h5>

<h3>Overview</h3>

  <br>
<p>The semester started with an abstract problem statement: Create a product with active technology to help geriatrics improve their health.
</p>
<div>
<img src="./images/problem.png">
<div>
<p>The range of health care issues geriatrics i.e.
people over the age of 65 face are not just physical but also emotional and mental. The following sections explore how we ended up making a smart seat.
We narrowed down our area of design intervention to "Independence" through the initial user research methods and brainstormed concepts which could tackle this issue.</p>

<br>

<h3>Methodology</h3>

<br>

  <div class="img">
    <img src="./images/ipdAsset 1@4x.png" alt="processes followed">
  </div>
<br>
<p>During our User Research phase some of the surprising numbers struck us and helped narrow down the scope:</p>

<div class="img">

</div>
<h5>Source : <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/elder/6836648/More-people-fear-losing-independence-in-old-age-than-death-survey-finds.html">A research study</a> by the National Disabled Living Foundation charity </h5>

<br>

<p>Another source of empathy were resources from the Design Charrette like an empathy map form potential users:</p>
<div class="img">
  <img src="./images/empathyAsset 1@4x.png" alt="processes followed">
</div>
<br>
<p>To tackle a more specific issue of independence we tried to walk through a day in the lives of our users:</p>
<div class="img">
  <img src="./images/day.png" alt="processes followed">
</div>
<br>
<p>The amount of research on this subject just kept increasing! To analyze all this qualitative (interviews,empathy maps,personas) and quantitative data (secondary research) we created
an affinity wall:</p>
<div class="img">
  <img src="./images/affinity.png" alt="processes followed">
</div>

<p>From our brainstorming session we formed high level research questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How might we help them restore their independence?</li>

<li>How might we help to prevent falls?</li>

<li>How might we reinforce their importance in society?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions were further explored through personas, concept testing, and a conjoint analysis.</p>
<div class="img-bg">
	<div class="img-detail-2">
		<img src="./images/persona1.png">
    <p>Notice the persona names? We used <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0953543806000476">Pastiche scenarios</a> here. </p>
		</div>
	<div class="img-detail-2">
		<img src="./images/persona2.png">
    <p>Super hero names  to emphasize on the idea of Independence and strength that these ficitional characters possess.</p>
		</div>

</div>

<h3>User Journey</h3>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/261901581" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h3>Concept Testing and Analysis</h3>
  <p>Three main concepts which were tested</p>
  <div class="img">
    <img src="./images/conceptsall.png">
  </div>
        <p><strong>Memory Box</strong>: Allows users to celebrate and record their life story and connect across generations.</p>
        <p><strong>Portable Smart seat</strong>: Helps to easily get up from sitting position without anyone’s help. Compact and saves the space.</p>
        <p><strong>Shakey</strong>: Provides users with a fun way to build strength and boost their mood with music.</p>

  <p>After skecthing out the prototypes and storyboarding them for our personas we moved on to making physical Prototyping of the concepts, we used cardboard and chocolates!</p>
  <div class="img">

  </div>



  <br>

  <h3>Choosing One Concept</h3>
  <p>Results from the concept tests were gathered through</p>
    <br>
  <div class="img">
    <img src="./images/numbers.png">
  </div>
    <br>
  <p>The portable inflatable seat was both popular by the numbers and opinion of our users.</p>
    <div class="img">
      <img src="./images/conjoint.png">
    </div>
    <br>
    <blockquote>“I would like something that really works. A lot of people find it hard to get up. At the church they added handles to the chair.”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"It should be discreet, I don’t want the whole room knowing I am using something."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“It is kind of demoralizing when I need so many tools to function but if I can choose let’s say the color of my cane that would make me happy!”</blockquote>
    <blockquote>“My wife needs this right now. When I help her get up I sometimes hurt her. Can you make this now?”</blockquote>

<h3>Product Prototypes</h3>
<p>After multiple iterations and validations by user testing we created a working prototype hacked using
Arduino, pressure sensors, and air pumps.</p>
